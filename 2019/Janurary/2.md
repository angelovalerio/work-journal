#### Just a follow up for Angelo
- May be we can ask Tom to add a comment here https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159023672 to mention `Folder` is not part of this phase
- Did we get the chance to validate https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bX_5x1-Cli_G0plaLZx9EkL2LiEmjjJi604M7tXQ8EA/edit
      - `Done` button styles
      - Invert button colors on the form and remove margin-top so itâ€™s tighter to question
- Some other small queries
      - Should short answer have multiline?
      - Radio buttons for single select
      - Date field => show year
      - What all validations are required for form fields
- Do we need to validate form before signing form?
- Do we need `Other` item at all levels to of hierarchy in list (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162720284/comments/198000545)
