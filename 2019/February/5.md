### Save and add another
- saving second signature shouldn't save form
   - when we save first time => save form, then submit signature
      - send signature data as well in form submit
   - when we add second time and beyond => it should only submit signature
      - call submit signature saga
   - ADD_TEMPLATE_SIGNATURE
      - send signature, formId and project Id
      - make api call
      - on success add it to list

- modal shouldn't close
- step => Select Employees
- handle form success message properly
